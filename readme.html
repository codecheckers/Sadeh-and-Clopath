This MATLAB code was contributed by Sadra Sadeh.<p/>
Example runs:<p/>
For rate based simulations type the following at the matlab command prompt:<p/>
<pre>
ISN_fs_1d
visualize__rateNet
</pre>
to produce the following graphs:

<p><img src="./images/screenshot2.png" alt="screenshot 2"></p>
<p><img src="./images/screenshot3.png" alt="screenshot 3"></p>
and for spiking simulations run:<p/>
<pre>
ISN_fs_1d__spikingNet
visualize__spikingNet
</pre>
which will generate the following<p/>
